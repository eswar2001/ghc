T1735_Help/State.hs:10:5: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monad-instances (in -Wdefault)]
    Noncanonical ‘return’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monad (StateT s m)’.
    ‘return’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘pure’
    Either remove definition for ‘return’ (recommended) or define as ‘return = pure’
