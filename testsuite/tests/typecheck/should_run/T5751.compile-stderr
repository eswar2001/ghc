    -XOverlappingInstances is deprecated: instead use per-instance pragmas OVERLAPPING/OVERLAPPABLE/OVERLAPS

T5751.hs:31:8: warning: [-Wsimplifiable-class-constraints (in -Wdefault)]
    • The constraint ‘Widgets m’ matches
        instance (XMLGenerator m, MonadRender m) => Widgets m
          -- Defined at T5751.hs:28:10
      This makes type inference for inner bindings fragile;
        either use MonoLocalBinds, or simplify it using the instance
    • In the type signature:
        web :: (MonadIO m, Widgets m, XMLGenerator m) => m ()
