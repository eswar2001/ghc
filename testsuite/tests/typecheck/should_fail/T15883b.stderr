    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘==’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Eq a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      These potential instances exist:
        instance Eq SpecConstrAnnotation -- Defined in ‘GHC.Exts’
        instance Eq Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
        instance Eq (Foo LiftedRep) -- Defined at T15883b.hs:14:1
        ...plus 24 others
        ...plus four instances involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    • In the expression: a1 == b1
      In an equation for ‘==’: (==) (MkFoo a1) (MkFoo b1) = ((a1 == b1))

        in a derived instance for ‘Eq (Foo LiftedRep)’:
        To see the code I am typechecking, use -ddump-deriv
