    • Could not deduce ‘C a0’
        arising when matching required constraints
        in a recursive group involving ‘doTail’
      from the context: C a
        bound by the type signature for:
                   indent :: forall a. C a => a -> a
        at T23427.hs:6:1-23
      The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    • In an equation for ‘indent’:
          indent n
            = doText n
            where
                doText x = const (f x) doTail
                doTail _ = const n doText
