    • Could not deduce (Show b0)
        arising from a type ambiguity check for
        an instance declaration
      from the context: (Eq a, Show b)
        bound by an instance declaration:

        at T7279.hs:6:10-35
      The type variable ‘b0’ is ambiguous
      These potential instances exist:
        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
        instance Show a => Show (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
        instance Show Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
        ...plus 23 others
        ...plus 13 instances involving out-of-scope types
        (use -fprint-potential-instances to see them all)
    • In the ambiguity check for an instance declaration
      To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
      In the instance declaration for ‘Eq (T a)’
