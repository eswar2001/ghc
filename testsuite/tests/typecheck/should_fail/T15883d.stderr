    • Ambiguous type variable ‘a0’ arising from a use of ‘showsPrec’
      prevents the constraint ‘(Show a0)’ from being solved.
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘a0’ should be.
      These potential instances exist:
        instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
        instance Show (Foo LiftedRep) -- Defined at T15883d.hs:14:1
        instance Show a => Show (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
        ...plus 28 others
        ...plus 9 instances involving out-of-scope types

      In the expression:
