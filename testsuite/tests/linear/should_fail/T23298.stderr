    • Couldn't match type ‘x1’ with ‘Maybe x1’
      Expected: HList x1 -> p
        Actual: HList a1 -> p
      ‘x1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        a pattern with constructor:
          HCons :: forall x. HList x %1 -> HList (Maybe x),
        in an equation for ‘go’
        at T23298.hs:12:30-36
    • In the expression: go x
      In an equation for ‘go’: go (HCons x) = go x
      In the expression: let go (HCons x) = go x in go ms
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: HList x1 (bound at T23298.hs:12:36)
