RepPolyPartialSig.hs:8:7: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The first pattern in the equation for ‘f’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        p :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘A’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: x :: (_ :: TYPE A)
      In an equation for ‘f’: f x = x :: (_ :: TYPE A)
    • Relevant bindings include
        x :: p (bound at RepPolyPartialSig.hs:8:3)
        f :: p -> w (bound at RepPolyPartialSig.hs:8:1)
