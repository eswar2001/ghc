RepPolyTupleSection.hs:11:7: error: [GHC-55287]
    • The second component of the tuple section
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        t1 :: TYPE t0
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘t0’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: (# 3#, #)
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = (# 3#, #)
    • Relevant bindings include
        foo :: a -> (# Int#, a #) (bound at RepPolyTupleSection.hs:11:1)
