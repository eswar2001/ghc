    • The tuple argument in first position
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        GUnboxed f rf :: TYPE k00
      Cannot unify ‘rf’ with the type variable ‘k00’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: (# gunbox x, gunbox y #)
      In an equation for ‘gunbox’:
          gunbox (x :*: y) = (# gunbox x, gunbox y #)

        ‘GUnbox (f :*: g) (TupleRep [rf, rg])’
