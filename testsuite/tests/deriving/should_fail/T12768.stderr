T12768.hs:9:33: error: [GHC-39999]
    • Could not deduce ‘D [a]’
        arising from the head of a quantified constraint
        arising from the coercion of the method ‘op’
          from type ‘D [a] => [a] -> [a]’ to type ‘D (N a) => N a -> N a’
      from the context: C a
        bound by the deriving clause for ‘C (N a)’ at T12768.hs:9:33
      or from: D (N a) bound by a quantified context at T12768.hs:9:33
      Possible fix:
        If the constraint looks soluble from a superclass of the instance context,
        read 'Undecidable instances and loopy superclasses' in the user manual
    • When deriving the instance for (C (N a))
