question about casting StgWord64 to StgWord
perhaps move additional arithmetic manipulations out of `parseArg`
print out flag 'tail' in some error messages
can we reuse STGWORD64 for DOUBLE? Just need to cast where we update RtsFlags state
also consider using all VOID ones as BOOLs
implement DEBUG_BUILD_ONLY
generalize void flag tests: VOID_FLAG_TEST
TODO: generate usage_text contents from rtsFlags
repurpose other tests into more compact, type-tests
implement the "program requires to be built with 'x' flag" hook
