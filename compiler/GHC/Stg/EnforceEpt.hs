{- Note [Evaluated and Properly Tagged]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A pointer is Evaluated and Properly Tagged (EPT) when the pointer

  (a) points directly to the value (not to an indirection, and not to a thunk)
  (b) is tagged with the tag corresponding to said value (e.g. constructor tag
      or arity of a function).

A binder is EPT when all the runtime pointers it binds are EPT.

Note that a lifted EPT pointer will never point to a thunk, nor will it be
tagged `000` (meaning "might be a thunk").

See https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/rts/haskell-execution/pointer-tagging
for more information on pointer tagging.

Examples:
* Case binders are always EPT; hence an eval
    case x of x' { __DEFAULT -> ... }
  ensures that x' is EPT even if x was not.
* Data constructor bindings
    let x = Just y in ...
  are EPT: x will point to the heap-allocated constructor closure for (Just y),
  and the tag-bits of the pointer will encode the tag for Just (i.e. `010`).
* In practice, GHC also guarantees that strict fields (and others) are EPT;
  see Note [EPT enforcement].

Caveat:
Currently, the proper tag for builtin *unlifted* data types such as `Array#` is
not `001` but `000`, which is not a proper tag for lifted data.
This means that UnliftedRep is not a proper sub-rep of LiftedRep.
SG thinks it would be good to fix this; see #21792.

Note [EPT enforcement]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The goal of EnforceEPT pass is to mark as many binders as possible as EPT
(see Note [Evaluated and Properly Tagged]).
To find more EPT binders, it establishes the following

EPT INVARIANT:
> Any binder of
>   * a strict field (see Note [Strict fields in Core]), or
>   * a CBV argument (see Note [CBV Function Ids])
> is EPT.

(Note that prior to EPT enforcement, this invariant may *not* always be upheld.
An example can be found at the end of this Note.)
This is all to optimise code such as the following:

  data SPair a b = SP !a !b
  case p :: SP Bool Bool of
    SP x y ->
      case x of
        True  -> ...
        False -> ...

We can infer that the strict field x is EPT and hence may safely
omit the code to enter x and the check for the presence of a tag that goes along
with it. However we still branch on the tag as usual to jump to the True or
False case.

Note that for every example involving strict fields we could find a similar
example using CBV functions, e.g.

  $wf x[EPT] y =
    case x of
      True  -> ...
      False -> ...

is the above example translated to use a CBV function $wf.
Note that /any/ strict function can in principle be chosen as a CBV function;
however, we presently only promote worker functions such as $wf to CBV because
we see all its call sites and can use the proper by-value calling convention.
More precisely, with -O0, we guarantee that no CBV functions are visible in
the interface file, so that naÃ¯ve clients do not need to know how to call CBV
functions. See Note [CBV Function Ids] for more details.

Specification
-------------
EPT enforcement works like implicit type conversions in C, such as from int to
float, only much simpler (no overloaded operations such as +).
For EPT enforcement, the "type system" in question is whether a binder is
statically EPT. We differentiate "EPT binder" from "non-EPT binder", where the
latter means "might be EPT, but we could not prove it so".
In this sense, EPT binders form a subtype of non-EPT binders.
We differentiate two conversion directions:

  * Downcast: EPT binders can be converted into non-EPT binders for free.
  * Upcast: non-EPT binders can be converted into EPT binders by inserting an eval.

The EPT invariant expresses type signatures. In particular, these type
signatures entail two things:

  * A _precondition_: Any binder that is passed as a CBV arg/strict field
    must be EPT (i.e. must have type "EPT binder").
  * A _postcondition_: Any binder of a CBV arg/strict field is EPT.

EPT enforcement is then simply a matter of figuring out where to insert
Upcasts (remember that Downcasts are free).
Since Upcasts (evals!) are not free, it is desirable to insert as few as possible.
To this end, we run a static *EPT analysis*, the purpose of which is to identify
as many EPT binders as possible.
Beyond discovering case binders and value bindings, EPT analysis exploits the
type signatures provided by the EPT invariant, looks inside returned tuples and
does some limited amount of fixpointing.
Afterwards, the *EPT rewriter* inserts the actual evals realising Upcasts.

Implementation
--------------

* EPT analysis is implemented in GHC.Stg.EnforceEpt.inferTags.
  It attaches its result to /binders/, not occurrence sites.
* The EPT rewriter establishes the EPT invariant by inserting evals. That is, if
    (a) a binder x is used to
          * construct a strict field (`SP x y`), or
          * passed as a CBV argument (`$wf x`),
        and
    (b) x was not inferred EPT,
  then the EPT rewriter inserts an eval prior to the call, e.g.
    case x of x' { __ DEFAULT -> SP x' y }.
    case x of x' { __ DEFAULT -> $wf x' }.
  (Recall that the case binder x' is always EPT.)
  This is implemented in GHC.Stg.EnforceEpt.Rewrite.rewriteTopBinds.
  This pass also propagates the EPTness from binders to occurrences.
  It is sound to insert evals on strict fields (Note [Strict fields in Core]),
  and on CBV arguments as well (Note [CBV Function Ids]).
* We also export the EPTness of top level bindings to allow this optimisation
  to work across module boundaries.
  NB: The EPT Invariant *must* be upheld, regardless of the optimisation level;
  hence EPTness is practically part of the internal ABI of a strict data
  constructor or CBV function. Note [CBV Function Ids] contains the details.
* Finally, code generation skips the thunk check when branching on binders that
  are EPT. This is done by `cgExpr`/`cgCase` in the backend.

Evaluation
----------
EPT enforcement can have large impact on spine-strict tree data structure
performance. For containers the reduction in runtimes with this optimization
was as follows:

intmap-benchmarks:    89.30%
intset-benchmarks:    90.87%
map-benchmarks:       88.00%
sequence-benchmarks:  99.84%
set-benchmarks:       85.00%
set-operations-intmap:88.64%
set-operations-map:   74.23%
set-operations-set:   76.50%
lookupge-intmap:      89.57%
lookupge-map:         70.95%

With nofib being ~0.3% faster as well.

Note that EPT enforcement may cause regressions in rare cases.
For example consider this code:

  foo x = ...
    let c = StrictJust x
    in ...

When x cannot be inferred EPT, the rewriter transforms to

  foo x = ...
    let c = case x of x' -> StrictJust x'
    in ...

which allocates an additional thunk for `c` that returns the constructor.  Boo!

Note [EPT enforcement lowers strict constructor worker semantics]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Core, a saturated application of a strict constructor worker evaluates its
strict fields and thus is *not* a value; see Note [Strict fields in Core].
This is also the semantics of strict constructor workers in STG *before* EPT
enforcement (see Note [EPT enforcement])

However, after enforcing the EPT Invariant, all constructor workers can
effectively be lazy. That is, when actually generating code to allocate the
data constructor, the code generator does not need to evaluate the argument;
that has already been done by the EPT pass.

Thus for code-gen reasons (StgToX), all constructor workers are considered lazy
after EPT enforcement.

Note [Why isn't the EPT Invariant enforced during Core passes?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recall the definition of the EPT Invariant from Note [EPT enforcement].
Why can't it be established as an invariant right while desugaring to Core?
The reason is that some Core optimisations, such as FloatOut, will drop or delay
evals whenever they think it useful and thus destroy the Invariant.  Example:

  data Set a = Tip | Bin !a (Set a) (Set a)

We start with

  thk = f ()
  g x = ...(case thk of xv -> Bin xv Tip Tip)...

So far so good; the argument to Bin (which is strict) is evaluated.
Now we do float-out. And in doing so we do a reverse binder-swap (see
Note [Binder-swap during float-out] in SetLevels) thus

  g x = ...(case thk of xv -> Bin thk Nil Nil)...

The goal of the reverse binder-swap is to allow more floating -- and
indeed it does! We float the Bin to top level:

  lvl = Bin thk Tip Tip
  g x = ...(case thk of xv -> lvl)...

Now you can see that the argument of Bin, namely thk, points to the
thunk, not to the value as it did before.

In short, although it may be rare, the output of Core optimisation passes
might destroy the EPT Invariant, hence we need to enforce the EPT invariant
*after* passes such as FloatOut.

{- Note [TagInfo of functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The purpose of tag inference is really to figure out when we don't have to enter
value closures. There the meaning of the tag is fairly obvious.
For functions we never make use of the tag info so we have two choices:
* Treat them as TagDunno
* Treat them as TagProper (as they *are* tagged with their arity) and be really
  careful to make sure we still enter them when needed.
As it makes little difference for runtime performance I've treated functions as TagDunno in a few places where
it made the code simpler. But besides implementation complexity there isn't any reason
why we couldn't be more rigorous in dealing with functions.

NB: It turned in #21193 that PAPs get tag zero, so the tag check can't be omitted for functions.
So option two isn't really an option without reworking this anyway.

Note [EPT enforcement debugging]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a flag -dtag-inference-checks which inserts various
compile/runtime checks in order to ensure the EPT Invariant
holds. It should cover all places
where tags matter and disable optimizations which interfere with checking
the invariant like generation of AP-Thunks.

Note [Polymorphic StgPass for inferTagExpr]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to reach a fixpoint we sometimes have to re-analyse an expression
multiple times. But after the initial run the Ast will be parameterized by
a different StgPass! To handle this a large part of the analysis is polymorphic
over the exact StgPass we are using. Which allows us to run the analysis on
the output of itself.

Note [EPT enforcement for interpreted code]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The bytecode interpreter has a different behaviour when it comes
to the tagging of binders in certain situations than the StgToCmm code generator.

a) Tags for let-bindings:

  When compiling a binding for a constructor like `let x = Just True`
  Whether `x` will be properly tagged depends on the backend.
  For the interpreter x points to a BCO which once
  evaluated returns a properly tagged pointer to the heap object.
  In the Cmm backend for the same binding we would allocate the constructor right
  away and x will immediately be represented by a tagged pointer.
  This means for interpreted code we can not assume let bound constructors are
  properly tagged. Hence we distinguish between targeting bytecode and native in
  the analysis.
  We make this differentiation in `mkLetSig` where we simply never assume
  lets are tagged when targeting bytecode.

b) When referencing ids from other modules the Cmm backend will try to put a
   proper tag on these references through various means. When doing analysis we
   usually predict these cases to improve precision of the analysis.
   But to my knowledge the bytecode generator makes no such attempts so we must
   not infer imported bindings as tagged.
   This is handled in GHC.Stg.EnforceEpt.Types.lookupInfo

{- Note [Bottom functions are TagTagged]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we have a function with two branches with one
being bottom, and the other returning a tagged
unboxed tuple what is the result? We give it TagTagged!
To answer why consider this function:

foo :: Bool -> (# Bool, Bool #)
foo x = case x of
    True -> (# True,True #)
    False -> undefined

The true branch is obviously tagged. The other branch isn't.
We want to treat the *result* of foo as tagged as well so that
the combination of the branches also is tagged if all non-bottom
branches are tagged.
This is safe because the function is still always called/entered as long
as it's applied to arguments. Since the function will never return we can give
it safely any tag sig we like.
So we give it TagTagged, as it allows the combined tag sig of the case expression
to be the combination of all non-bottoming branches.

NB: After the analysis is done we go back to treating bottoming functions as
untagged to ensure they are evaluated as expected in code like:

  case bottom_id of { ...}

{- Note [Constructor TagSigs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@inferConTag@ will infer the proper tag signature for a binding who's RHS is a constructor
or a StgConApp expression.
Usually these will simply be TagProper. But there are exceptions.
If any of the fields in the constructor are strict, but any argument to these
fields is not tagged then we will have to case on the argument before storing
in the constructor. Which means for let bindings the RHS turns into a thunk
which obviously is no longer properly tagged.
For example we might start with:

    let x<TagDunno> = f ...
    let c<TagProper> = StrictPair x True

But we know during the rewrite stage x will need to be evaluated in the RHS
of `c` so we will infer:

    let x<TagDunno> = f ...
    let c<TagDunno> = StrictPair x True

Which in the rewrite stage will then be rewritten into:

    let x<TagDunno> = f ...
    let c<TagDunno> = case x of x' -> StrictPair x' True

The other exception is unboxed tuples. These will get a TagTuple
signature with a list of TagInfo about their individual binders
as argument. As example:

    let c<TagProper> = True
    let x<TagDunno> = ...
    let f<?> z = case z of z'<TagProper> -> (# c, x #)

Here we will infer for f the Signature <TagTuple[TagProper,TagDunno]>.
This information will be used if we scrutinize a saturated application of
`f` in order to determine the taggedness of the result.
That is for `case f x of (# r1,r2 #) -> rhs` we can infer
r1<TagProper> and r2<TagDunno> which allows us to skip all tag checks on `r1`
in `rhs`.

Things get a bit more complicated with nesting:

    let closeFd<TagTuple[...]> = ...
    let f x = ...
        case x of
          _ -> Solo# closeFd

The "natural" signature for the Solo# branch in `f` would be <TagTuple[TagTuple[...]]>.
But we flatten this out to <TagTuple[TagDunno]> for the time being as it improves compile
time and there doesn't seem to huge benefit to doing differently.
